<h2>Customer Shopping Insights </h2>

<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p>
We analyzed shopping patterns in 10 malls in Istanbul from 2021 to 2023, looking at different age groups and both men and women. Using a star schema data model, we explored details like invoices, customer profiles, payment types, products, and mall locations. Using Power BI for data visualization, we created various visuals—including pie charts, bar graphs, column graphs, stacked bars, funnel diagrams, line graphs, and comparison tables—to clearly present the patterns and trends.
